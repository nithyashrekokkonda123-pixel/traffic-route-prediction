# Traffic Route Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting optimal traffic routes using historical traffic data. 
The goal is to analyze traffic patterns and suggest efficient routes to reduce travel time.

## Problem Statement
Traffic congestion causes delays and fuel wastage. Using historical data, this project 
predicts traffic intensity and helps in route optimization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- CSV data

## Approach
1. Collected historical traffic data
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
3. Performed feature engineering
4. Applied machine learning models for prediction
5. Evaluated results to identify optimal routes

## Key Learnings
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling real-world datasets
- Feature engineering
- Applying ML models for prediction

## Note
This repository focuses on project documentation and approach. Code implementation 
will be added in future updates.
